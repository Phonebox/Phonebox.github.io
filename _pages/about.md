I started creating games with Unity in 2016, released my first game called VR Squash 2017 in the next year. Since then I worked on multiple VR and 2D based projects.

In the meantime I also got interested in photography, therefore I decided to mix the two and create textures based on my own photos. This got me into making Unity materials, my first assets should be releasing soon in the Unity asset store.
