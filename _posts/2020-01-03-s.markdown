Hey All!

I just created my first Unity asset, a stone wall based on real photography I made on Gran Canaria, texture features:

* 4k resolution

* all render pipelines: standard, Universal (former LWRP), HDRP

* PBR (normals, occulsion maps included) - so reflections and lights are correct

* tiling

I hope you find it useful and please if you have any feedback or improvement options let me know on info@davidcseh.com

Cheers,
David
