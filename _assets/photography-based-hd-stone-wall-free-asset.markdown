Hey All!

I just created my first Unity asset, a stone wall based on real photography I made on Gran Canaria, texture features:
* 4k resolution
* all render pipelines: standard, Universal (former LWRP), HDRP
* PBR (normals, occulsion maps included) - so reflections and lights are correct
* tiling

I hope you find it useful and please if you have any feedback or improvement options let me know on [info@davidcseh.com](info@davidcseh.com)

Cheers,
David
